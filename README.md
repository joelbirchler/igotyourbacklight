Simple program to adjust the backlighting on my laptop.

* `igotyourbacklight` outputs the current backlight stats.
* `igotyourbacklight <int>` where int is a number between -100 and 100 adjusts the brightness up or down by %.

*Example:*

`igotyourbacklight -10` makes the screen 10% dimmer.

## TODO

* figure out how to test
* better instructions for install and usage with i3wm
